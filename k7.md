I: Why is your favorite programming language your favorite programminglanguage

B: So i would say my favorite programming language is python, I really like it because of the large standartlibrary, but also the syntax. The way the language is build, it makes it really easy to prototype something very quickly, As for example (unverst√§ndlich) is really useful, it allows you to build scripts very quickly, and dont have to deal with a type system is another thing. And is also has a very logical system, there is a python module for everything. And most of the time these modules are fairly high quality. And of course its popular, like a lot of people know it so its easy to find help, find like stackoverflow threads, and also when you send somebody a python script the chances that they know the language are quite high, If i would use a language like Rust maybe its not so easy, Not many people know it
