I: What is your favorite programming language

BBC-Basic, because i learned it when i was 6 or 7 old at primary school, and its the onyl one i really learned

Stylisticly Java is probaly my favorite, i used that for many years. But now i mostly used python, but iam not quite as competend as i liked to be with it.

favorite? probably PHP because its where iam best at. Its messy

Python, if been using for... it was the first like real language that i properly started using in like 2007, somethin like that. i was in fairly early on python. Its now how i think, to the point where i can't actually write pseudo code, if i try to write python by accident,... best language, best syntax anyway

Oh, my new favorite programming language is python, because you can do really anything with it, its pretty amazing

Oh i don't know about favorite, they all have there pros and cons, i work a lot with javascript. 

Javascript, (...) i used to hate it, but then i did and internship doing frontend web developement, and i actually really really like it now. And using the newer versions like ES6 , i really enjoy it. 

commen lisp, because i can do anything i want in it. 

i guess its javascript at the moment, you do so much with it, its hard to, i don't if i use any other ones

its getting more difficult actually, but i still like C# the best. I think that if you are programming Windows, which of course not everyone is, in programming windows its much easier to get a userinterface up and running in C#, it got's lot of librarys and its also a statically typed language which i like
